# Echo Runbook

## What Echo Is For

Echo tells the operator which Crypto Twitter narratives are durable enough to matter after the first hype wave.

## Daily Operator Loop

1. Run `bun run dev` (optional: start Redis locally or set `REDIS_URL` for cross-restart narrative state).
2. Read the research board for the top-ranked narrative.
3. Check credibility, persistence, and contradiction together.
4. Escalate only the claims that are still broadening without strong pushback.

## What Gets Promoted

- claims repeated across quality source clusters
- narratives that persist across multiple windows
- stories with low contradiction pressure

## What Gets Demoted

- one-cluster echo loops
- viral but short-lived claims
- narratives with a growing opposing lane
